</head><body>Layer 4, is the transport layer of the OSI model. TCP vs UDP.<br/>
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): a connection oriented protocol.It is best suited when it comes to high reliability,it's connection oriented. Making connections, we need high relibility. Eg: a website which is http, https, or SSH, or FTP (File Transfer Protocol), these are all utilized TCP.<br/>
TCP is the most comonly used and scanned protocol. It works on what is called a three (3) way handshake.<br/>
The 3 way handshake looks like this: send out a SYN packet, recieve back a SYN ACK packet and then send an ACK packet. <br/>
<br/>
Ports are items that can be open on a machine, it's a way to communicate with certain protocols. Eg: hhtp is over port 80, https is over port 443, etc<br/>
<br/>
Layman explanation: want to connect tp port 443 on a website, (1) send out a SYN packet to website, saying "I want to connect to you on port 443", if 443 is open and availablefor connection,(2) the website says "sure, you can connect to me and it send the SYS ACK (Acknowledgement packet), (3) when connection is to be established, ACK (Acknowledgement packet) is sent back to website. <br/>
<br/>
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): a connectionless protocol. Eg: streaming service or DNS or voice over IP.<br/>
