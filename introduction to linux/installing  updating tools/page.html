<title>Installing &amp; updating tools</title>
</head><body>This is a very important part in the introduction to Linux. We're going to cover, how to install files, how to install updates and how to get files from github, these are very very important.<br/>
<br/>
So updating your system from the terminal in linux: apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade<br/>
<br/>
<b>NB: I had an error running the above command and had to go goole what my error meant and how to fix it. So if you run into any errors at all, in any of the processes, your first thought should be "Google" and I can say you'll almost always find the solution. At least, i always have.</b><br/>
<br/>
If you just want a specific tool, for example, to install a tool called pip: apt install python-pip. We're going to be working quite a lot with python and i'll dedicate a different post section for that as we move along.<br/>
<br/>
After or during your pip install, open up your browser and goole github inpacket. <br/>
Inpacket ia tool (it comes with Kali but this is a stable version)-kit used during exploitation,so make sure you click on the SecureAuthCorp (should be the first in your search result), copy the clone URL (make sure you read through the installation process) and type this in your terminal: git clone paste the copied URL.Now, inpacket is cloned in your machine, cd into the cloned file, follow the installation instructions and it should install all the things needed for python related to this program.<br/>
<br/>
These are a few ways to install tools. Most times the tools needed will have to be downloaded from Github, so this should give you and idea of how to make update or install tools from github.<br/>
