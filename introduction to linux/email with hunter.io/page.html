<br/>
We're going to be taking a realistic approach and using a realistic methodology, that'll help you in the real world as a Penetration Tester.We're going to start with Hunter.io tool. You'll need to sign up for it, with a valid e-mail. You'll automatically be on a free plan which allows about 20 searches a month, so bevery careful with your search, make sure it's what you need.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go ahead and assume you've signed up and are logged in, search for your clients website in the search box, in my case, it's tesla.com (make sure you're following the rules of engagement. <br/>
<br/>
Reason to use Hunter.io:<ul><li>It gives a list of people in the organization. First name, last name. </li>
<li>Also gives the most common pattern with thier e-mail addresses.</li>

<br/>
Hving this first name last name, e-mail structure is really helpful. In cases where, you search LinkedIn and find other employees, you already have the format of their e-mails, with just knowing thier names.<br/>
<br/>
As methods of exploitation, we're going to be looking at password spraying an credential stuffing. We'll look into that when we get into the scanning, enemeration and exploitation phase We wpuld use these methods in a situation where, we've have the names, e-mail format and want to try logging into a form, we can use the emil structure and run password spraying to guess the passwords. <br/>
<br/>
Password spraying is when we take commonly used passwords and run them against usernames or e-mails.</body></html>
