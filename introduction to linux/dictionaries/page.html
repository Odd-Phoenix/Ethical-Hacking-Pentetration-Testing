</head><body><b>Dictionaries.</b><br/>
<br/>
Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.<br/>
<br/>
You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value.<br/>
<br/>
Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:<br/>
<ul><li>Both are mutable.</li>
<li>Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.</li>
<li>Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary. A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Dictionaries differ from lists primarily in how elements are accessed:<br/>
<ul><li>List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.</li>
<li>Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.</li>
</ul>

Example of a dictionary<br/>
<br/>
So the drink is your key and the price is your value, hence the key-value pair. There can be multiple values to a single key.<br/>

Dictionary with single key to multiple values. <br/>
<br/>
What if we wanted to add another key-value pair, how do you think we'd go about that? Lets try that with our employee example, we'll add a new department.<br/>
There are multiple ways to add new key-value pair, here's one way:<br/>

<br/>
In a situation where a value has changed, we can update the value in our dictionary. Lwts use the drink example:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 5.png" /><br/>
<br/>
The price for the Ice Tea got updated from 5 to 7.<br/>
W can also get a particlar item out from our dictionary, instaed of printing out all the information. Here's how we can go about that:<br/>

<b>NB:</b><ul><b><li>Lists have brackets []</li>
<li>Tuples have parenthesis ()</li>
</b><li><b>Dictionaries have curly braces {}</b></li>
</ul>

This is one of those areas in Python you won't need or see in this course but it's also a very valuable thing to know and be able to tellthem apart, if and when you read any code.<br/>
