<title>Gathering Credentials With Breach-Parse</title>
</head><body><b>Gathering Credentials With Breach-Parse.</b><br/>
<br/>
Breach Parse is a tool created by The Cyber Mentor and someone else, from dumped credentials on the deep web, to make compilations of emails and passwords acquired from previous breaches. <br/>
It;s a really large file to pull from Git, about 40GB or more. I'll pull it when I get a larger space laptop. <br/>
<br/>
Just go to GitHub.com/hmaverickadams and click on breach-parse.<br/>
