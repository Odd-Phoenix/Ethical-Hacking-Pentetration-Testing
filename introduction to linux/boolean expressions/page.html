</head><body><b>Boolean Expressions.</b><br/>
<br/>
A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either true or false.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The above image has 4 bool statements. For bool2, 3 * 3 is equal to (, so that is true but bool4 means that 3 * 3 is not equal to 9, which is obviously false. So, in layman terms, boolean expressions are statements whose results are either true or false. <br/>
print(type(def function)), is how you print out what of variable is stored in the function. <br/>
<br/>
<b>NB: There is a difference between True and "True". The first is a boolean while the other is a string, characters within quotes are seen as the type of string.<br/>
<br/>

You will use boolean expressions in exploit development, loops and conditional statements. Conditional statements, if something is true, then run a certain code and if it's false, run a different code.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's build upon this. Just remember, everytime you hear or see oolean expressions, it's simple True or False.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Relational and Boolean Operators.</b><br/>
<br/>
A relational operator takes two non-Boolean primitive operands, compares them and yields true or false. <br/>
In English, a relational operator compares two expression and determins if they both are true or false (returns a boolean value). For instance, we want to compare if (7&gt;3) and (4&lt;9), a relational operators compares both to see if they are trueand return the appropriate boolean expression. In this case, both are true, making the entire statement true. <br/>
In a case where one is false and the other is true, the entire statement will be false, the "and" is what determines that. <br/>
<br/>
To know if a statment with two epressions are true of false:<ul><li>In the instance of OR, the outcome if true, if both exprssions are true.</li>
<li>Still for OR, if one or the other expressions are true, then the outcome is true.</li>
<li>For the outcome of OR to be false, both expressions have to be false.</li>
<li>In the instance of AND, both expressions have to be true, in order for the outcome to be true</li>
<li>Still AND, if one of the expressions are false, the outcome of the comparison becomes false</li>
</ul>

I highly recommend going out on the internet to study this, it can be a bil confusing at first. Make sure you unerstand them, cause we'll continue to build on themas we go along.<br/>
Don't only focus on the True and False, but the greater/less than sysmbols, and/or &amp; not<br/>
<br/>
The goal of learning Python is not essentially to be a developer, which is not as important, but being able to read and understand what is going on or what you see, is very important.<br/>
<br/>
You can start here, with a true false chart.<br/>

Moving on to conditional statements, if, then else.<br/>
